    "Due to the pandemic, there were only 60 regular season games in the 2020 MLB season, as opposed to 162 in a normal year. To work around this, I lowered the plate appearance threshold in 2020 to 70, which resulted in a similar-sized player pool (approximately 350) to the rest of the years, and for any \"counting stats,\" like Home Runs or Plate Apppearances or whatever, I will scale them up by an appropriate factor to make it seem like it was over a 162 game season. This does however not address the variance in home runs vs. predictive factors in a smaller sample of games (i.e. hitting 15 home runs in 60 games when the data suggests the expected HR total was 10 now becomes hitting 40 home runs with an expected total of like 25), but we're just going to have to live with it and hopefully that variance evens out across the player pool."
